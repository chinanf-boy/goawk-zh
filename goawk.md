AWK is a fascinating text processing language, and [*The AWK Programming Language*](https://ia802309.us.archive.org/25/items/pdfy-MgN0H1joIoDVoIC7/The_AWK_Programming_Language.pdf) is a wonderfully concise book describing it. The A, W, and K in AWK stand for the surnames of the three original creators: Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan. Kernighan is also an author of *The C Programming Language* ("K&R"), and the two books have that same each-page-packs-a-punch feel.

AWK was released in 1977, which makes it over 40 years old! Not bad for a domain-specific language that's still used for one-liners on Unix command lines everywhere.

I was still on a bit of an "interpreter high" after implementing a [little language](/writings/littlelang/) of my own as well as Bob Nystrom's [Lox language in Lox](/writings/loxlox/). After reading the AWK book I thought it'd be fun (for some nerdy value of "fun") to write an interpreter for it in Go. How hard could it be?

As it turns out, not too hard to get it working at a basic level, but a bit tricky to get the correct [POSIX AWK](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/awk.html) semantics and to make it fast.

First, a brief intro to the AWK language (skip to the next section if you already know it).


Overview of AWK
---------------

If you're not familiar with AWK, here's a one-sentence summary: AWK reads a text file line by line, and for each line that matches a pattern expression, it executes an action (which normally prints output).

So given an example input file (a web server log file) where each line uses the format `"timestamp method path ip status time"  `:

    2018-11-07T07:56:34Z GET /about 1.2.3.4 200 0.013
    2018-11-07T07:56:35Z GET /contact 1.2.3.4 200 0.020
    2018-11-07T07:56:37Z POST /contact 1.2.3.4 200 1.309
    2018-11-07T07:56:40Z GET /robots.txt 123.0.0.1 404 0.004
    2018-11-07T07:57:00Z GET /about 2.3.4.5 200 0.014
    2018-11-07T08:00:00Z GET /asdf 3.4.5.6 404 0.005
    2018-11-07T08:00:01Z GET /fdsa 3.4.5.6 404 0.004
    2018-11-07T08:00:02Z HEAD / 4.5.6.7 200 0.008
    2018-11-07T08:00:15Z GET / 4.5.6.7 200 0.055
    2018-11-07T08:05:57Z GET /robots.txt 201.12.34.56 404 0.004
    2018-11-07T08:05:58Z HEAD / 5.6.7.8 200 0.007
    2018-11-07T08:05:59Z GET / 5.6.7.8 200 0.049

If we want to see the IP addresses (field 4) of all hits to the "about" page, we could write:

    $ awk '/about/ { print $4 }' server.log 
    1.2.3.4
    2.3.4.5

The pattern above is the slash-delimited regex `/about/`, and the action is to print the fourth field (`$4`). By default, AWK splits the line into fields on whitespace, but the field separator is easily configurable, and can be a regex.

Normally a regex pattern matches the entire line, but you can match on an arbitrary expression too. The above would match URL `/not-about` too, but you can tighten it up to test that the path (field 3) is exactly `"/about"`:

    $ awk '$3 == "/about" { print $4 }' server.log 
    1.2.3.4
    2.3.4.5

If we want to determine the average response time (field 6) of all GET requests, we could sum the response time and count the number of GET requests, then print the average in the `END` block -- 18 milliseconds, not bad:

    $ awk '/GET/ { total += $6; n++ } END { print total/n }' server.log 
    0.0186667

AWK supports hash tables (called "associative arrays"), so you can print the count of each request method like so -- notice the pattern is optional, and omitted here:

    $ awk '{ num[$2]++ } END { for (m in num) print m, num[m] }' server.log 
    GET 9
    POST 1
    HEAD 2

AWK has two scalar types, string and number, but it's been described as "stringly typed", because the comparison operators like `==` and `<` do numeric comparisons if the data comes from user input and parses as a number, otherwise they do string comparisons. This sounds sloppy, but for text processing it's usually what you want.

The language supports the usual range of C-like expressions and control structures (`if`, `for`, etc). It also has a range of builtin functions like `substr()` and `tolower()`, and it supports user-defined functions complete with local variables and array parameters.

So it's most definitely Turing-complete, and is actually quite a nice, powerful language. You can even [generate the Mandelbrot set](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/master/examples/mandel.awk) in a couple dozen lines of code:

    $ awk -f examples/mandel.awk

And that's AWK in a very small nutshell.


Code walkthrough
----------------

GoAWK is not ground-breaking in terms of compiler design. It's made up of a lexer, parser, resolver, interpreter, and main program ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk)). Only packages from the Go standard library were used in the making of this program.

### Lexer

It all starts with the [lexer](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/master/lexer/lexer.go), which converts AWK source code into a stream of tokens. The guts of the lexer is the `scan()` method, which skips whitespace and comments, then parses the next token: for example, `DOLLAR`, `NUMBER`, or `LPAREN`. Each token is returned with its source code position (line and column) so the parser can include this information in syntax error messages.

The bulk of the code (in the `Lexer.scan` method) is just a big switch statement that switches on the token's first character. Here's a snippet:

```go
// ...
switch ch {
case '$':
    tok = DOLLAR
case '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '.':
    start := l.offset - 2
    gotDigit := false
    if ch != '.' {
        gotDigit = true
        for l.ch >= '0' && l.ch <= '9' {
            l.next()
        }
        if l.ch == '.' {
            l.next()
        }
    }
    // ...
    tok = NUMBER
case '{':
    tok = LBRACE
case '}':
    tok = RBRACE
case '=':
    tok = l.choice('=', ASSIGN, EQUALS)
// ...
```

One of the quirky things about AWK grammar is that parsing `/` and `/regex/` is ambiguous -- you have to know the parsing context to know whether to return a `DIV` or a `REGEX` token. So the lexer exposes a `Scan` method for normal tokens and a `ScanRegex` method for the parser to call where it expects a regex token.

### Parser

Next is the [parser](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/master/parser/parser.go), a fairly standard recursive-descent parser that creates an [abstract syntax tree (AST)](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/master/internal/ast/ast.go). I didn't fancy learning how to drive a parser generator like `yacc` or bringing in an external dependency, so GoAWK's parser is hand-rolled with love.

The AST nodes are simple Go structs, with `Expr` and `Stmt` as interfaces that are implemented by each expression and statement struct, respectively. The AST nodes can also pretty-print themselves by calling the `String()` method -- this was very useful for debugging the parser, and you can enable it by specifying `-d` on the command line:

    $ goawk -d 'BEGIN { x=4; print x+3; }'
    BEGIN {
        x = 4
        print (x + 3)
    }
    7

The AWK grammar is a bit quirky in places, not the least of which is that expressions in `print` statements don't support `>` or `|` except inside parentheses. This is supposed to make redirecting or piping output simpler.

* `print x > y` means print variable `x` redirected to a file with name `y`
* `print (x > y)` means print boolean true (1) if `x` is greater than `y`

I couldn't figure out a better way to do this than two paths down the recursive-descent tree -- `expr()` and `printExpr()` in the code:

```go
func (p *parser) expr() Expr      { return p.getLine() }
func (p *parser) printExpr() Expr { return p._assign(p.printCond) }
```

Builtin function calls are parsed specially, so that the number of arguments (and in some cases the types) can be checked at parse time. For example, parsing `match(str, regex)`:

```go
case F_MATCH:
    p.next()
    p.expect(LPAREN)
    str := p.expr()
    p.commaNewlines()
    regex := p.regexStr(p.expr)
    p.expect(RPAREN)
    return &CallExpr{F_MATCH, []Expr{str, regex}}
```

A lot of parsing functions flag an error on invalid syntax or an unexpected token. It makes life easier to not check these errors at every step, but rather `panic` with a special `ParseError` type which is `recover`ed at the top level. This avoids a ton of repetitive error handling in the recursive descent code. Here's how the top-level `ParseProgram` function does that:

```go
func ParseProgram(src []byte, config *ParserConfig) (
        prog *Program, err error) {
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            // Convert to ParseError or re-panic
            err = r.(*ParseError)
        }
    }()
    // ...
}
```

### Resolver

The [resolver](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/master/parser/resolve.go) is actually part of the parser package. It does basic type checking of arrays versus scalars, and assigns integer indexes to all variable references (to avoid slower map lookups at execution time).

I think the way I've done the resolver is non-traditional: instead of making a full pass over the AST, the parser records just what's necessary for the resolver to figure out the types (a list of function calls and variable references). This is probably faster than walking the whole tree, but it probably makes the code a bit less straight-forward.

In fact, the resolver was one of the harder pieces of code I've written for a while. It's the one piece of the GoAWK source I'm not particularly happy with. It works, but it's messy, and I'm still not sure I've covered all the edge cases.

The complexity comes from the fact that when calling functions, you don't know whether an argument is a scalar or an array at the call site. You have to peruse the types in the called function (and maybe in the functions it calls) to determine that. Consider this AWK program:

    function g(b, y) { return f(b, y) }
    function f(a, x) { return a[x] }
    BEGIN { c[1]=2; print f(c, 1); print g(c, 1) }

The program simply prints `2` twice. But when we're calling `f` inside `g` we don't know the types of the arguments yet. It's part of the resolver's job to figure this out in an iterative fashion. (See [`resolveVars`](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/a75cecd04d8aa8829c04b97bf370c8afaf53a68e/parser/resolve.go#L223) in `resolve.go`.)

After figuring out the unknown arguments types, the resolver assign integer indexes to all variable references, global and local.

### Interpreter

The interpreter is a simple tree-walk interpreter. The interpreter implements statement execution and expression evaluation, input/output, function calls, and the base value type.

*Statement execution* starts in [interp.go](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/master/interp/interp.go) with `ExecProgram`, which takes a parsed `Program`, sets up the interpreter, and then executes `BEGIN` blocks, patterns and actions, and `END` blocks. Executing the actions includes evaluating pattern expressions and determining if they match the current line. This includes "range patterns" like `NR==4, NR==10`, which matches lines between the start and the stop pattern.

A statement is executed by the `execute` method, which takes a `Stmt` of any type, performs a big type `switch` on it to determine what kind of statement it is, and executes the behavior of that statement.

*Expression evaluation* works the same way, except it happens in the `eval` method, which takes an `Expr` and switches on the expression type.

Most binary expressions (apart from the short-circuiting `&&` and `||`) are evaluated via `evalBinary`, which contains a further switch on the operator token, like so:

```go
func (p *interp) evalBinary(op Token, l, r value) (value, error) {
    switch op {
    case ADD:
        return num(l.num() + r.num()), nil
    case SUB:
        return num(l.num() - r.num()), nil
    case EQUALS:
        if l.isTrueStr() || r.isTrueStr() {
            return boolean(p.toString(l) == p.toString(r)), nil
        } else {
            return boolean(l.n == r.n), nil
        }
    // ...
}
```

In the `EQUALS` case you can see the "stringly typed" nature of AWK: if either operand is definitely a "true string" (not a numeric string from user input), do a string comparison, otherwise do a numeric comparison. This means a comparison like `$3 == "foo"` does a string comparison, but `$3 == 3.14` does a numeric one, which is what you'd expect.

AWK's associative arrays map very well to a Go `map[string]value` type, so that makes implementing those easy. Speaking of which, Go's garbage collector means we don't have to worry about writing our own GC.

*Input and output* is handled in [io.go](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/master/interp/io.go). All I/O is buffered for efficiency, and we use Go's `bufio.Scanner` to read input records and `bufio.Writer` to buffer output.

Input records are usually lines (`Scanner`'s default behavior), but the record separator `RS` can also be set to another character to split on, or to empty string, which means split on two consecutive newlines (a blank line) for handling multiline records. These methods still use `bufio.Scanner`, but with a custom split function, for example:

```go
// Splitter function that splits records on the given separator byte
type byteSplitter struct {
    sep byte
}

func (s byteSplitter) scan(data []byte, atEOF bool)
        (advance int, token []byte, err error) {
    if atEOF && len(data) == 0 {
        return 0, nil, nil
    }
    if i := bytes.IndexByte(data, s.sep); i >= 0 {
        // We have a full sep-terminated record
        return i + 1, data[0:i], nil
    }
    // If at EOF, we have a final, non-terminated record; return it
    if atEOF {
        return len(data), data, nil
    }
    // Request more data
    return 0, nil, nil
}
```

Output from `print` or `printf` can be redirected to a file, appended to a file, or piped to a command: this is handled in `getOutputStream`. Input can come from stdin, a file, or be pipe from a command.

*Functions* are implemented in [functions.go](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/master/interp/functions.go), including both builtin and user-defined functions.

The `callBuiltin` method again uses a large switch statement to determine the AWK function we're calling, for example `split()` or `sqrt()`. The builtin `split` requires special handling because it takes a non-evaluated array parameter. Similarly `sub` and `gsub` actually take an "lvalue" parameter that's assigned to. For the rest of the functions, we evaluate the arguments first and perform the operation.

Most of the functions are implemented using parts of Go's standard library. For example, all the math functions like `sqrt()` use the standard `math` package, `split()` uses `strings` and `regexp` functions. GoAWK re-uses Go's regular expressions, so obscure regex syntax might not behave identically to the "one true awk".

Speaking of regexes, I cache compilation of regexes using a simple bounded cache, which is enough to speed up almost all AWK scripts:

```go
// Compile regex string (or fetch from regex cache)
func (p *interp) compileRegex(regex string) (*regexp.Regexp, error) {
    if re, ok := p.regexCache[regex]; ok {
        return re, nil
    }
    re, err := regexp.Compile(regex)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, newError("invalid regex %q: %s", regex, err)
    }
    // Dumb, non-LRU cache: just cache the first N regexes
    if len(p.regexCache) < maxCachedRegexes {
        p.regexCache[regex] = re
    }
    return re, nil
}
```

I also cheat with AWK's `printf` statement, converting the AWK format string and types into Go types so I can re-use Go's `fmt.Sprintf` function. Again, this format string conversion is cached.

User-defined calls use `callUser`, which evaluates the function's arguments and pushes them onto the locals stack. This is somewhat more complicated than you'd think for two reasons: first, you can pass arrays as arguments (by reference), and second, you can call a function with fewer arguments than it has parameters.

It also checks the call depth (currently maximum 1000), to avoid a panic in case of unbounded recursion.

*Values* are implemented in [value.go](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/master/interp/value.go). GoAWK values are strings or numbers (or "numeric strings") and use the `value` struct, which is passed by value, and is defined as follows:

```go
type value struct {
    typ      valueType // Value type (nil, str, or num)
    isNumStr bool      // True if str value is a "numeric string"
    s        string    // String value (typeStr)
    n        float64   // Numeric value (typeNum and numeric strings)
}
```

Originally I had made the GoAWK value type an `interface{}` which held `string` and `float64`. But you couldn't tell the difference between regular strings and numeric strings, so decided to go with a struct. And my hunch is that it's better to pass a small 4-word struct by value than by pointer, so that's what I did (though I haven't verified that).

To detect "numeric strings" (see `numStr`), we simply trim spaces and use Go's `strconv.ParseFloat` function. However, when string values are being explicitly converted to numbers in `value.num()`, I had to roll my own parsing function because those conversions allow things like `"1.5foo"`, whereas `ParseFloat` doesn't.

### Main

The main program in [goawk.go](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/master/goawk.go) rolls all of the above together into the command-line utility `goawk`. Again, nothing fancy here -- it even uses the standard Go `flag` package for parsing command-line arguments.

The `goawk` utility has a little helper function, `showSourceLine`, which shows the error line and position of syntax errors. For example:

    $ goawk 'BEGIN { print sqrt(2; }'
    --------------------------------------------
    BEGIN { print sqrt(2; }
                        ^
    --------------------------------------------
    parse error at 1:21: expected ) instead of ;

There's nothing special about `goawk`: it just calls the `parser` and `interp` packages. GoAWK has a pretty simple Go API, so check out the [GoDoc API documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/benhoyt/goawk) if you want to call it from your own Go programs.


How I tested it
---------------

### Lexer tests

The [lexer tests](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/master/lexer/lexer_test.go) use [table-driven tests](https://dave.cheney.net/2013/06/09/writing-table-driven-tests-in-go), comparing source input to a stringified version of the lexer output. This includes checking the token position (line:column) as well as the token's string value (used for `NAME`, `NUMBER`, `STRING`, and `REGEX` tokens):

```go
func TestLexer(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        input  string
        output string
    }{
        // Names and keywords
        {"x", `1:1 name "x"`},
        {"x y0", `1:1 name "x", 1:3 name "y0"`},
        {"x 0y", `1:1 name "x", 1:3 number "0", 1:4 name "y"`},
        {"sub SUB", `1:1 sub "", 1:5 name "SUB"`},

        // String tokens
        {`"foo"`, `1:1 string "foo"`},
        {`"a\t\r\n\z\'\"b"`, `1:1 string "a\t\r\nz'\"b"`},
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

### Parser tests

The parser doesn't really have explicit unit tests, except [`TestParseAndString`](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/a75cecd04d8aa8829c04b97bf370c8afaf53a68e/parser/parser_test.go#L17) which tests one big program with all of the syntax constructs in it -- the test is simply that it parses and can be serialized again via pretty-printing. My intention here is to test the parsing logic in the interpreter tests.

### Interpreter tests

The [interpreter unit tests](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/master/interp/interp_test.go) are another long list of table-driven tests. They're a little more complicated than the lexer tests -- they take the AWK source, expected input and expected output, and also an expected error string and AWK error string if the test is supposed to cause an error.

You can optionally run the interpreter tests against an external AWK intepreter by specifying a command-line like `go test ./interp -awk=gawk`. I've ensured it works against both `awk` and `gawk` -- the error messages are quite different between the two, and I've tried to account for that by testing against just a substring of the error message.

Sometimes `awk` and `gawk` have known different behaviour, or don't catch quite the same errors as GoAWK, so in a few of the tests I have to exclude an interpreter by name -- this is done using a special `!awk` ("not awk") comment in the source string.

Here's what the interpreter unit tests look like:

```go
func TestInterp(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        src    string
        in     string
        out    string
        err    string // error from GoAWK must equal this
        awkErr string // error from awk/gawk must contain this
    }{
        {`$0`, "foo\n\nbar", "foo\nbar\n", "", ""},
        {`{ print $0 }`, "foo\n\nbar", "foo\n\nbar\n", "", ""},
        {`$1=="foo"`, "foo\n\nbar", "foo\n", "", ""},
        {`$1==42`, "foo\n42\nbar", "42\n", "", ""},
        {`$1=="42"`, "foo\n42\nbar", "42\n", "", ""},
        {`BEGIN { printf "%d" }`, "", "",
            "format error: got 0 args, expected 1", "not enough arg"},
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

### Command line tests

I also wanted to test the `goawk` command-line handling, so in [`goawk_test.go`](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/master/goawk_test.go) there's another set of table-driven tests that test things like `-f`, `-v`, `ARGV`, and other things related to the command line:

```go
func TestCommandLine(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        args   []string
        stdin  string
        output string
    }{
        {[]string{"-f", "-"}, `BEGIN { print "b" }`, "b\n"},
        {[]string{"-f", "-", "-f", "-"}, `BEGIN { print "b" }`, "b\n"},
        {[]string{`BEGIN { print "a" }`}, "", "a\n"},
        {[]string{`$0`}, "one\n\nthree", "one\nthree\n"},
        {[]string{`$0`, "-"}, "one\n\nthree", "one\nthree\n"},
        {[]string{`$0`, "-", "-"}, "one\n\nthree", "one\nthree\n"},
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

These are tested against the `goawk` binary as well as an external AWK program (which defaults to `gawk`).

### AWK test suite

I also test GoAWK against Brian Kernighan's "one true awk" test suite, which are the `p.*` and `t.*` files in the `testdata` directory. The `TestAWK` function in [`goawk_test.go`](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/master/goawk_test.go) drives these tests. The output from the test programs is compared against the output from an external AWK program (again defaulting to `gawk`) to ensure it matches.

A few test programs, for example those that call `rand()` can't really be diff'd against AWK, so I exclude those. And for other programs, for example those that loop through an array (where iteration order is undefined), I sort the lines in the output before the diff.

### Fuzz testing

One last type of testing I used is "fuzz testing". This is a method of sending randomized inputs to the interpreter until it breaks. I caught several crashes (panics) this way, and even [one bug](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/commit/89cf2a2c3958f2e602d553a9abc418aa0031a0f0) in the Go compiler which caused an out-of-bounds slice access to segfault (though I found that had already been fixed in Go 1.11).

To drive the fuzzing, I simply used the [go-fuzz](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz) library with a `Fuzz` function:

```go
func Fuzz(data []byte) int {
    input := bytes.NewReader([]byte("foo bar\nbaz buz\n"))
    err := interp.Exec(string(data), " ", input, &bytes.Buffer{})
    if err != nil {
        return 0
    }
    return 1
}
```

Fuzz testing found a number of bugs and edge cases I hadn't caught with the other methods of testing. Mostly these were things you wouldn't write in real code, but it's nice to have a tireless robot help you add a layer of robustness. In GoAWK, fuzz testing found at least these issues:

* [c59731f](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/commit/c59731f5543bf9b48cf92a981b66696a5ab0ceae): Fix panic with using built-in (scalar) in array context

* [b09e51f](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/commit/b09e51f64689e12c466e951ed1b8add17742be9f): Disallow setting NF and $n past 1,000,000 (fuzzer found this)

See [fuzz/README.txt](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/blob/master/fuzz/README.txt) for details on how to run the fuzzer.


Improving performance
---------------------

[Skip the discussion, jump to the numbers!](#performance-numbers)

Performance issues tend to be caused by bottlenecks in the following areas, from most to least impactful (thanks to Alan Donovan for this succinct way of thinking about it):

1. Input/output
2. Memory allocations
3. CPU cycles

If you're doing too many I/O or system calls, that's going to be a huge hit.

Memory allocations are next: they're costly, and one of the key things Go gives a good amount of control over is memory allocation (for example, the "cap" argument to `make()`).

Finally comes CPU cycles -- this is often the least impactful, though it's sometimes the only thing people think of when we talk about "performance".

In GoAWK, I've done some optimization in all three areas. The biggest wins to be had for typical AWK programs were related to I/O -- as expected, because AWK programs normally read input, process it a bit, and write output. But there were some important gains to be had in the allocation and CPU departments too.

### How I profiled

Where the bottlenecks are is often unintuitive, so *measurement* is key. Let's look at how you measure what's going on in your Go code.

It's fairly easy to instrument code for profiling using the standard library [`runtime/pprof` package](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/pprof/). (You can read more about [profiling Go programs here](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs).)

First I added a `-cpuprofile` command line flag, and if that's set, enable CPU profiling. Here's what that looks like in code:

```go
if *cpuprofile != "" {
    f, err := os.Create(*cpuprofile)
    if err != nil {
        errorExit("could not create CPU profile: %v", err)
    }
    if err := pprof.StartCPUProfile(f); err != nil {
        errorExit("could not start CPU profile: %v", err)
    }
}
// ... run interp.Exec ...
if *cpuprofile != "" {
    pprof.StopCPUProfile()
}
```

Then you can run the AWK program you want to profile:

```
$ ./goawk -cpuprofile=prof 'BEGIN { for (i=0; i<100000000; i++) s++ }'
```

And finally use the `pprof` tool to view the output (the `-http` flag fires up a tab in your web browser with a couple of nice ways to view the data):

```
$ go tool pprof -http=:4001 prof
```

Here's a screenshot of the "top" view, which I found most helpful:

![pprof's "top" view](/images/goawk-pprof.png)

From this screenshot you can see a couple of things immediately:

* Variable access via maps is slowing us down (`getVar`, `mapassign`, `mapaccess`)
* The `panic`-based error handling is rather slow (all the `defer` lines)

Both of these I've addressed as described below. I ran the profiler many more times on different kinds of AWK programs, and found a number of issues, starting with I/O.

### The performance improvements

Sure enough, GoAWK had I/O issues -- I wasn't buffering writes to stdout. So microbenchmarks looked okay, but real AWK programs ran many times slower than necessary. So **speeding up output** was one of the first optimizations I made (and later I realized I'd forgotten to do this for redirected output too):

* [60745c3](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/commit/60745c3503ba3d99297816f5c7b5364a08ec47ab): Buffer stdout (and stderr) for 10x speedup
* [6ba004f](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/commit/6ba004f5fbf9b84bc6196d50c2a0dd496ed1771b): Buffer redirected output for performance

Next I changed to using **switch/case for binary operations** instead of looking up the function in a map and calling it. It's not obvious this will be faster, particularly as `switch` in Go jumps down through the list of `case`s and doesn't use "computed gotos". But I guess the constant factors involved in calling a function outweigh that in many cases:

* [ad8ff0e](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/commit/ad8ff0e5f6cc89fdd480099614187ee23b20a8c9): Speed up binary ops by moving from map to switch/case

```

...
```

Interestingly, some of my improvements slowed down *completely unrelated* code paths. I still don't really know why. Is it measurement noise? I don't think so, because it seems quite consistent. My guess is that it's the fact that the machine code has been rearranged and somehow causes cache misses or branch prediction changes in other parts of the code.

The next big change was to **resolve variable names to indexes at parse time.** Previously I was doing all variable lookups in a `map[string]value` at runtime, but variable references in AWK can be resolved at parse time, and then the interpreter can look them up in a `[]value` instead. It also avoids allocations in some cases as variables are assigned as the map grows:

```

Initially I had `interp.eval()` return just the `value` and panic with a special error on runtime error, but that was a significant slow-down, so I switched to using more verbose but more Go-like **error return values.** This would be a lot nicer with the [proposed `check` keyword](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft-error-handling-overview.md), but oh well. This change gave a 2-3x improvement on a lot of benchmarks:

...
```

The next improvement was a couple of small but effective tweaks to `evalIndex`, which evaluates a slice of array expressions to produce a key string. In AWK, arrays can be indexed by multiple subscripts like `a[1, 2]`, which actually just mashes them together into the string `"1{SUBSEP}2"` (the subscript separator defaults to `\x1c`).

But most of the time you only have a single subscript, so I **optimized the common case.** And for the multiple-subscript case, I did an initial allocation -- hopefully on the stack -- with `make([]string, 0, 3)` to avoid heap allocation for up to three subscripts.

ArrayOperations-8       1.80µs ± 1%  1.13µs ± 1%  -37.52%
```

Another case of **reducing allocations** was speeding up function calls by ensuring that calls with up to seven arguments don't require heap allocations. This sped up calls to a number of builtins by 2x.

* [e45e209](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/commit/e45e2090d44c08b340555f483e1f5bf42160e199): Speed up calls to builtin funcs by reducing allocations

BuiltinSprintf-8        14.3µs ± 4%  12.6µs ± 0%  -12.50%
...
```

The next optimization was **avoiding a heavyweight tool** (`text/scanner`) for simply converting strings to numbers. I was using `Scanner` because it allows you to parse things like `1.23foo` (AWK allows this when the string isn't coming from user input), and `strconv.ParseFloat` doesn't handle that.

I simply wrote my own lexing function to find the end of the actual floating-point number in the string, and call `ParseFloat` on that. This speeds up explicit string to number
conversions by more than 10x!

```
$ cat test.awk
BEGIN {
    for (i=0; i<1000000; i++) {
        "1.5e1"+"1"; "1.5e1"+"1"; "1.5e1"+"1"; "1.5e1"+"1"; "1.5e1"+"1";
        "1.5e1"+"1"; "1.5e1"+"1"; "1.5e1"+"1"; "1.5e1"+"1"; "1.5e1"+"1";
    }
}
$ time ./goawk_before test.awk
real    0m10.692s
$ time ./goawk_after test.awk
real    0m0.983s
```

One other thing I did was speed up the lexer by **avoiding UTF-8 decoding** during lexing. There's no good reason not to keep everything as bytes, and it gave the lexer a 2-3x speed boost with these commits:

* [0fa32f9](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/commit/0fa32f929b27bc55bcb8d68507853f1083d8ae02): Speed up lexer by avoiding UTF-8 decode

### Performance numbers

So how does GoAWK compare to the other AWK implementations? Pretty well! In the following chart:

* `goawk` refers to the current version of GoAWK ([commit 109e8a9](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/commit/109e8a9d645cb454e13582ab34f0f9d6d3fbdcfd))
* `orig` refers to the first "properly working" version of GoAWK, without optimizations ([commit 8ab5446](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk/commit/8ab54463f01a7d7d018be26a2f618cbd3c82538d))
* `awk` is "one true awk" version 20121220
* `gawk` is GNU Awk version 4.2.1
* `mawk` is mawk version 1.3.4 (20171017)

The numbers below represent the average time taken to run the given test over 3 runs, normalized to the `goawk` running time -- *lower is better*. As you can see, GoAWK is significantly faster than `awk` in most cases and not too bad compared to `gawk`!

Test      | goawk |  orig |   awk |  gawk |  mawk

Where to from here?

I'd love to know if you use [GoAWK](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk), and please send bug reports and code feedback my way. If you don't have a need for GoAWK, at least you've learned about AWK in general, and how useful a tool it is.

Thanks for reading!
